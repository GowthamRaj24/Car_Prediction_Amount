# Car_Prediction_Amount

It's a Basic Deep Learning Project using Artificial Neural Network.

# Problem Statement
We are supposed to develop a predictive model which will predict the Total Amount in Dollars that the customers are willing to pay to purchase a Car given the following attributes: Gender, Age, Annual Salary, Credit Card Debt, Net Worth.

# The Task
To Predict the Total Amount in Dollars that they're going to pay for a Car.
This a Classic Regression Problem and I've developed this model using Artificial Neural Network with 3 Dense Layer Model in a Sequential Manner. Here, The Optimizer being used is "Adam" and loss is measured with accordance to "mean_squared_error".
